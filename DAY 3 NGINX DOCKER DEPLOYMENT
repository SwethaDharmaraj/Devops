NGINX Docker Website Deployment Documentation
1. Project Title

Containerization and Deployment of a Dress Shop Website using Nginx and Docker

2. Objective

To design a static dress shop website and deploy it using Nginx inside a Docker container. The project demonstrates containerization, version control with GitHub, and web deployment concepts.

3. Technologies Used

HTML – Website structure

Nginx – Web server

Docker – Containerization platform

Git & GitHub – Version control and repository hosting

Ubuntu – Development environment

4. Project Description

This project involves building a simple dress shop home page and deploying it using Docker with Nginx as the web server. The website files are stored in a GitHub repository, and Docker is used to package the application into a container for easy deployment.

The container serves the website through port mapping, making it accessible via a browser.

5. System Architecture

Flow:

Website (index.html)
        ↓
Docker Image Build
        ↓
Nginx Container
        ↓
Port Mapping (8081 → 80)
        ↓
Browser Access

7. Implementation Steps
Step 1 — Create Website

A static HTML file (index.html) was created for the dress shop homepage.

Step 2 — Create Dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80

This Dockerfile:

Uses the official Nginx image

Copies website files into the Nginx directory

Exposes port 80

Step 3 — Build Docker Image
docker build -t dress-shop .

This creates a Docker image for the website.

Step 4 — Run Docker Container
docker run -d -p 8081:80 dress-shop

Runs the container in detached mode

Maps port 8081 of the system to port 80 inside the container

Step 5 — Access Website

Open browser:

http://localhost:8081

The dress shop website loads successfully.

Step 6 — Version Control using GitHub

Repository created and pushed:

Website files

Dockerfile

README documentation

Git commands used:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
8. Deployment Result

Website successfully containerized using Docker

Nginx served the static site

GitHub repository created for project management

Website accessed via browser using port mapping
