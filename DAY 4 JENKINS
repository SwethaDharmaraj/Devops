Jenkins Documentation
Continuous Integration Setup for Dockerized Website
1. Project Title

Implementation of Continuous Integration using Jenkins for Docker-based Website Deployment

2. Objective

To automate the build and deployment process of a website using Jenkins. The project demonstrates CI/CD concepts by integrating GitHub, Docker, and Jenkins in an Ubuntu environment.

3. Introduction

Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to implement Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). It helps developers automatically build, test, and deploy applications whenever changes are pushed to a repository.

In this project, Jenkins is used to automate the deployment of a dress shop website containerized using Docker.

4. Technologies Used

Jenkins – Automation server

Docker – Container platform

GitHub – Source code repository

Nginx – Web server

Ubuntu – Operating system

5. System Architecture

Workflow:

Developer pushes code → GitHub
          ↓
Jenkins detects changes
          ↓
Build Docker image
          ↓
Run Docker container
          ↓
Deploy website
6. Jenkins Installation Steps (Ubuntu)
Step 1 — Install Java
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
Step 2 — Install Jenkins
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y
Step 3 — Start Jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
Step 4 — Access Jenkins

Open browser:

http://localhost:8080

Unlock using:

sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
7. Jenkins Configuration

Installed suggested plugins

Created admin user

Connected GitHub repository

Configured build job

8. Jenkins Job Creation
Step 1 — Create New Job

Open Jenkins dashboard

Click “New Item”

Select “Freestyle Project”

Step 2 — Connect GitHub Repo

Add repository:

https://github.com/SwethaDharmaraj/dress-shop-docker
9. Build Configuration

Add build steps:

docker build -t dress-shop .
docker run -d -p 8081:80 dress-shop

This builds and deploys the container automatically.
